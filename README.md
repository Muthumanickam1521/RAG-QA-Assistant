## Motivation

Have you ever struggled to understand the breakdown of your credit card bill? I did too! I used to create separate Excel sheets just to verify charges. I wished I had a CA friend to simplify my bills, but I don't. That's why I created this Agentic RAG system (ARAG).

In simple terms, ARAG allows you to upload a document (in various formats) and ask questions about it. The system parses the document, retrieves relevant information, and provides clear, concise answers.

## Have a Question About Your File?

To use the application, you'll need:

  * A document (.pdf, .txt, .csv, .xlsx, .docx)
  * A question

**Instructions:**

1.  Access the Streamlit app [Insert Streamlit App Link Here].
2.  Upload your file (please wait a few seconds for processing).
3.  Ask your question!

## Limitations

Like any project, this RAG application has a few limitations:

1.  Currently handles only one file at a time.
2.  Does not process unstructured data beyond supported file types.
3.  Generates text-based responses only.
4.  PDF parsing accuracy may vary.

## Future Versions

I plan to address these limitations and develop a more robust RAG application with the following enhancements:

1.  **Agent Orchestration:** Implement a team of specialized agents working collaboratively to accomplish complex tasks and goals.
2.  **Multi-Document Handling:** Enable the system to process and answer questions from multiple uploaded documents simultaneously.
3.  **Enhanced Indexing and Retrieval:** Integrate semantic-based indexing and retrieval mechanisms for improved accuracy and efficiency.
4.  **Multimedia Support:** Expand the system to handle and generate responses based on images and other multimedia content.
5.  **Improved PDF Parsing:** implement a more robust and accurate PDF parser.
6.  **User Authentication:** Add user authentication to improve data security.
7.  **API Integration:** Create an API for integration into other applications.

## Collaboration and Opportunities

I'm actively seeking collaboration opportunities, contributing to **open-source** projects, and available for freelance work. If you have any projects where I can contribute, please reach out to [pearlrubymv@gmail.com](mailto:pearlrubymv@gmail.com). Let's build something great together!
